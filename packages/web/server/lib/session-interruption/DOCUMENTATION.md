# Session interruption

## Purpose

Records why OpenCode interrupted a session's last turn, so the UI can tell a
question OpenCode killed from one the user stopped.

OpenCode 2.x evicts a directory's location after 60 minutes without session
events and interrupts every execution there first (`location-activity.ts`,
reason `inactivity`). A `question` waiting for an answer emits no events, so
a question left unanswered for an hour ends with its tool part in `error`.
The UI shows such a question again as answerable (`orphanedQuestions.ts`).
A Stop errors the part the same way, and the reason that tells them apart
lives only on the live `session.execution.interrupted` event: OpenCode
stores `interrupted` and nothing more.

## Files

- `runtime.js` — `createSessionInterruptionRuntime({ persistMetadata, updateMetadata, buildOpenCodeUrl, getOpenCodeAuthHeaders })`,
  fed by the global hub subscriber in `server/index.js`; `recordRestartInterruptions` is called by its `onOpenCodeRestarted`.
- `restart.js` — the restart record patch, `findInterruptedTool`,
  `findOpenAssistantMessageID` and the `opencode-restart-interrupted`
  notification payload.
- `auto-resume.js` — the resume message, the automatic resume of priority
  sessions and the notice's Continue (`continueManually`).
- `routes.js` — `POST /api/openchamber/sessions/:sessionId/restart-resume`
  with `{ at, directory? }`: 200 sent, 409 the record changed or was already
  resumed, 502 OpenCode did not take the message.

## State

`metadata.openchamber.interruption`: `{ reason, at, cause, tool }`, written
for every interruption that reaches the hub as `session.idle` with
`aborted: true` (`user`, `superseded`, `inactivity`; `cause` and `tool` are
null there, so the write replaces a restart record whole). `shutdown` never does, because OpenCode
resumes that turn. `at` is the arrival time, so it is at least the session's
`time.idle` for that turn; a later turn moves `time.idle` past it and the
record stops counting. The UI parser is `inactivityInterruptionAt` in
`packages/ui/src/lib/questions/orphanedQuestions.ts`.

## A managed OpenCode restart

A restart of the managed OpenCode kills every running turn with reason
`shutdown`, which the hub drops, so nothing above records it. After the
restart, `recordRestartInterruptions({ sessionIds, cause })` writes on each
session `session-runtime.js` settled:

```jsonc
{ "reason": "opencode-restart", "at": 1760649461000,
  "cause": "memory-pressure",          // memory-pressure | health-timeout | process-exited | unknown
  "tool": { "name": "shell", "input": "sleep 600", "callID": "toolu_…" },   // or null
  "resume": null }                     // a cut-off question: { "state": "manual", "reason": "question-pending" }
```

- `cause` comes from the lifecycle (`../opencode/cgroup-memory.js`).
- `tool` is the last tool call of the newest turn whose state is `running`,
  `streaming`, or `error` with `error.type: "aborted"`, read from the 30
  newest message records after the restart. `input` is the first of
  `command`, `filePath`, `path`, `url`, `pattern`, `query`, `description`,
  flattened and cut to 200 characters.
- A cut-off `question` waits for the user's answer, so its record starts as
  `resume: { state: 'manual', reason: 'question-pending' }`. The automatic
  resume only claims a record without `resume`, so a priority session is
  skipped too, decided from the persisted tool.
- Each session is read and written on its own (`updateMetadata`, decided at
  write time in the store's queue). A failed read records `tool: null`, a
  failed write is logged, and neither stops the other sessions or the toast.
- The record is cleared when the user sends the next message in the session,
  answers a cut-off question, presses Continue, or dismisses the notice. The
  UI deletes the key through the metadata route
  (`dismissRestartInterruption` in `packages/ui/src/sync/session-actions.ts`),
  Continue on the server once its message is in. While a cut-off question is
  answerable in the form dock, the UI hides the notice and the question card
  shows the time and cause instead. The UI parser is
  `packages/ui/src/lib/sessionRestartInterruption.ts`; the notice is
  `SessionRestartInterruptionRow.tsx` above the composer.

### The turn the restart cut off

OpenCode leaves the killed turn open, its tool `running`, until the session
runs again. The same write records which message that was:

```jsonc
"restartCutTurn": { "messageID": "msg_…", "at": 1760649461000, "callID": "toolu_…", "toolName": "shell" }
```

`null` when the newest turn had no open assistant message. Dismiss, Continue
and a sent message leave it; the next restart replaces it. The UI finalizes
that message and its running tools as interrupted while it is still the
session's last conversation message (`restartCutTurnToolParts` in
`packages/ui/src/sync/sync-context.tsx`), and keeps its question answerable
(`packages/ui/src/lib/questions/orphanedQuestions.ts`).

### A question waiting for the user

When the cut-off tool is a `question` whose input reads (restart), or an
inactivity eviction errored one (its newest messages are read for that reason
only), the same write records it:

```jsonc
"pendingQuestion": { "messageID": "msg_…", "callID": "toolu_…", "title": "Which color?",
                     "cause": "opencode-restart" | "inactivity", "at": 1760649461000 }
```

`null` otherwise, which also clears an older one. The UI shows the session as
waiting for the user from it (`packages/ui/src/sync/pending-questions.ts`), and
the notification center gets a `question` entry. The UI clears it when the
question is answered or dismissed and with any sent message; this server
clears it when it sees the session run again (`session.status` busy), only for
a record older than that turn and only for sessions it recorded one on.

### Continue

Continue sends the same message as the automatic resume, with
`trigger: 'continue'`, then deletes the record. It is decided in the store's
queue like the automatic resume: it claims the record written at that `at`
unless its resume is already `sent`, which also stops an automatic resume
still waiting for memory. A failed send puts the previous `resume` back.

## Priority sessions

`metadata.openchamber.priority = { at }`: the user marked the session as a
priority (the UI sets it through the metadata route and deletes the key to
clear it; `packages/ui/src/lib/sessionPriority.ts`). An absent key or any
other shape means an ordinary session.

## Automatic resume

Only priority sessions; every other session keeps the notice and Continue.
After `recordRestartInterruptions`, `index.js` hands its answer to
`autoResumeRuntime.resume`, which sends the agent one message saying what was
cut off, the cause, the time and the running command, and asking it to check
the files it changed and the processes it started before repeating anything
(`buildResumeMessage`). Its progress is written on the restart record:

```jsonc
"resume": { "state": "waiting" | "sent" | "manual", "at": 1760649500000,
            "reason": "memory-timeout" | "memory-unreadable" | "send-failed" | "question-pending" }  // manual only
```

Every step is decided in the metadata store's write queue against the record
as it is then:

- **Once per interruption.** A record is claimed (`waiting`) only while it
  has no `resume`, and marked `sent` before the message goes out. A new
  restart writes a new record with `resume: null`, and every other
  interruption record also carries `resume: null`, so an old state never
  carries over. A crash between `sent` and the send loses that one message
  rather than repeating it.
- **The user wins.** A message the user sends or Dismiss deletes the record;
  the priority switched off, or a newer restart, also stops the resume. Each
  is checked again right before `sent`.
- **Memory.** After a `memory-pressure` restart the messages wait, once for
  all sessions of that restart, until the cgroup is calm:
  `full avg60 < RESUME_MEMORY_CALM_FULL_AVG60` (2 percent) with the
  `high`/`max` counters unchanged since the previous read, polled every
  `RESUME_MEMORY_POLL_MS` (15 s). Past `RESUME_MEMORY_DEADLINE_MS` (10 min)
  the record becomes `manual` with `memory-timeout`; memory that cannot be
  read becomes `manual` with `memory-unreadable`. A server that stops while
  waiting leaves `waiting` behind; the UI reads a `waiting` older than 15
  minutes as `manual`.
- **A failed send** (OpenCode not answering within 15 s) becomes `manual`
  with `send-failed`; it is not retried.

The message is a synthetic message with `resume: true`, so the session's own
agent and model answer it, and its metadata
(`{ source: 'openchamber-notice', kind: 'restart-resume', trigger, at, cause, tool }`)
makes the transcript show an OpenChamber row instead of a user message
(`packages/ui/src/lib/opencode/openchamber-resume.ts`). The answer to a
cut-off question travels the same way with `kind: 'question-answer'`, sent by
the UI. The result of a job that finished during the restart is not in the
message yet: that needs the execution queue (stage 2).

## Runtimes

- Web, desktop, hosted and Capacitor mobile: recorded, and priority
  sessions resumed, by this server.
- VS Code: the extension host runs no hub subscriber and owns its own
  OpenCode lifecycle, so nothing is recorded or resumed, and the priority
  mark only lists the session first; a question errored by
  inactivity stays an error there. The notice still renders for a record
  another server wrote, without Continue (the extension has no route to send
  it), and Dismiss works through the metadata bridge. The rows, the
  interrupted turn and an answer to a cut-off question work there too: they
  read session metadata and use only OpenCode's own API.
- A turn interrupted while this server was not running has no record and is
  left as an error.
